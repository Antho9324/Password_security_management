# Password Security Analyzer (Python)

## Project Overview
This project is a Python-based security tool designed to evaluate the strength of passwords based on modern cybersecurity standards. It uses regular expressions (regex) to validate complexity requirements, helping users ensure their credentials are resilient against common attack vectors like brute-force or dictionary attacks.

## Features
The analyzer checks for four critical security criteria:
* **Minimum Length:** Ensures the password is at least 12 characters long.
* **Casing:** Verifies the presence of both uppercase and lowercase letters.
* **Digits:** Checks for at least one numerical character.
* **Special Characters:** Detects the use of non-alphanumeric symbols (e.g., !@#$%^&*).

## Technical Skills Demonstrated
* **Regular Expressions (Regex):** Utilizing the `re` module for advanced pattern matching.
* **Conditional Logic:** implementing a scoring system to provide dynamic user feedback.
* **Input Handling:** Capturing and processing user data securely.
* **Code Cleanliness:** Writing modular, reusable functions with clear documentation.

## How it Works
1. **Input:** The user is prompted to enter a password for analysis.
2. **Validation:** The `verifier_password()` function runs multiple regex searches to find matches for each security criterion.
3. **Scoring:** For every criterion met, a score counter is incremented.
4. **Feedback:** - **Strong:** All criteria are met (Score: 4).
   - **Medium:** Some criteria are missing; specific improvement tips are provided.
   - **Weak:** The password fails most safety checks and is flagged as dangerous.
